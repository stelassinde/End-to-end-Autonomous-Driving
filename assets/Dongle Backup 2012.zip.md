A dongle is a small device that plugs into a USB or LPT port and provides software protection or authentication. Dongles are often used by software developers to prevent unauthorized copying or piracy of their products. However, dongles can also be damaged, lost, or stolen, which can cause problems for the users who rely on them. In such cases, having a backup of your dongle can save you time and money.
